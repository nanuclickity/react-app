 * Use match to match routes statically without going through a render-pass

 *  - preferably in the component provided to route itself
 *  - watch out for HOCs like connect(), withRouter()
 * 
 * As soon as route is matched, get the matched components, 
 * drill into component's children till you find a fetchData method
